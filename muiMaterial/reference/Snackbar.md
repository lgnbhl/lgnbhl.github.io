<https://mui.com/material-ui/api/snackbar/>

## Usage

``` r
Snackbar(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Props to pass to the component.

## Value

Object with `shiny.tag` class suitable for use in the UI of a Shiny app.

## Details

- action `node`  
  Default is - The action to display. It renders after the message, at
  the end of the snackbar.

- anchorOrigin
  `{ horizontal: 'center'| 'left'| 'right', vertical: 'bottom'| 'top' }`  
  Default is vertical: 'bottom', horizontal: 'left' The anchor of the
  Snackbar. On smaller screens, the component grows to occupy all the
  available width, the horizontal alignment is ignored.

- autoHideDuration `number`  
  Default is null The number of milliseconds to wait before
  automatically calling the onClose function. onClose should then set
  the state of the open prop to hide the Snackbar. This behavior is
  disabled by default with the null value.

- children `element`  
  Default is - Replace the SnackbarContent component.

- classes `object`  
  Default is - Override or extend the styles applied to the
  component.See CSS classes API below for more details.

- ClickAwayListenerProps `object`  
  Default is - Props applied to the ClickAwayListener element.Deprecated
  Use slotProps.clickAwayListener instead. This prop will be removed in
  a future major release. See Migrating from deprecated APIs for more
  details.

- ContentProps `object`  
  Default is - Props applied to the SnackbarContent element.Deprecated
  Use slotProps.content instead. This prop will be removed in a future
  major release. See Migrating from deprecated APIs for more details.

- disableWindowBlurListener `bool`  
  Default is FALSE If true, the autoHideDuration timer will expire even
  if the window is not focused.

- key `any`  
  Default is - When displaying multiple consecutive snackbars using a
  single parent-rendered Snackbar, add the key prop to ensure
  independent treatment of each message. For instance, use Snackbar
  key=message. Otherwise, messages might update in place, and features
  like autoHideDuration could be affected.

- message `node`  
  Default is - The message to display.

- onClose `func`  
  Default is - Callback fired when the component requests to be closed.
  Typically onClose is used to set state in the parent component, which
  is used to control the Snackbar open prop. The reason parameter can
  optionally be used to control the response to onClose, for example
  ignoring clickaway.Signature:function(event: React.SyntheticEvent \|
  Event, reason: string) = voidevent The event source of the
  callback.reason Can be: "timeout" (autoHideDuration expired),
  "clickaway", or "escapeKeyDown".

- open `bool`  
  Default is - If true, the component is shown.

- resumeHideDuration `number`  
  Default is - The number of milliseconds to wait before dismissing
  after user interaction. If autoHideDuration prop isn't specified, it
  does nothing. If autoHideDuration prop is specified but
  resumeHideDuration isn't, we default to autoHideDuration / 2 ms.
